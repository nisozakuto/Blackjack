# Blackjacl Game Proposal

## What is BlackJack?

Blackhjack is a card game that is played amongst friends, groups and even casinos. When I was very young I used to play with it with my cousin, without  betting!

I haven't played it for years and don't exactly remember the rules. I had to look the rules up.

I thought to make a card game would be very cool, for a few reason. When I was working as in a QA role, my company came up with a card game and that was something I have never done it before. Now doing this course, I would like to accomplish developing a a card game. I think it would give me a lot of satisfaction.

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure

1. Getting random cards from the deck. It will require me to use random method and matching with the cards. I need to calculate the amount of cards are on the table.
2. Player can split, I will work on that last. As I it seems the most difficult to me.
3. Winning state, in Tic Tac Toe that was the longest time I spent on the project. I will try to approach it in a better way this time.
4. Restarting the game and keeping the scores. I do not have so much experience on this. 

## Phases of Completion

Prepare the table. Throw cards that is the start of the game.
Then buttons need to take action and give cards to the player.
Each time there is a new card on the table, it should run a few functions to check if the game is won or not.
If it is won, then maybe restart or display the current status of the game.
Repeat...

I could not find the work I did from here but there was a small dice game I practiced a few monts ago. I was planning to use the logic for matching the cards to the images.
