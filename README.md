# Blackjack

Blackjack game built with Javascript


While developing this game, one of the challange I faced is: if different Aces can have different values. 
After reading multiple articles and rules from different sources I found the below information and formed my logic around with it
```
The hand is always scored to give the best possible value for the player, such that they have the highest score they can get without going bust. The player never chooses the values or the score; it is decided by the rule and the cards on the table.
A+A+X will always be valued as 12+X, unless this would bust, in which case it must be valued as 12 (since the only such X is a ten-value card, and therefore the only non-bust score is for both aces to be one-value).
